# Secure Instrument Link
This project describes a secure XML-based format
for data exchange between LIMS/ELN software and LC-MS
instruments in the domain of bioanalysis.

The goal is to provide a secure exchange mechanism for two main interactions:
* Worklist submission (LIMS to instrument)
* Result reporting (Instrument to LIMS)
